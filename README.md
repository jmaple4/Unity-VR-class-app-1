# Unity-VR-class-app-1

This is a simple VR app built in unity based on the [Introduction to VR with Unity](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-vr-with-unity/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy.com. 

You can download the Adroid APK file here: [Build 3a](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vr-unity-class-1/AndroidBiuild/unity-vr-3a.apk).

This app is only available on Android phones running Daydream (preferable) or cardboard vr viewers. Currently, users have to use a Nintendo switch Pro gamepad for executing actions on the screens. When you look at a block or a place you want to go, long press either the `a` or `b` button on the switch gamepad. 

Visiting the VR Maze is a one-way-door and there is not way to return to the starting screen. I apologise for this but the class didn't make the return path very clear in the tutorial.
