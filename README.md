# Unity-VR-class-app-1

This is a simple VR app built in unity based on the [Introduction to VR with Unity](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-vr-with-unity/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy.com. 

Currently, users have to use a Nintendo switch Pro gamepad for executing actions on the screens. Visiting the VR Maze is a one-way-door and there is not way to return to the starting screen.
